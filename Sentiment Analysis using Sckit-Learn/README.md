This Notebook contains some of the basic techniques or I can say some basic starting steps that we need to perform for the sentiment analysis using sklearn.

I have caclulated idf-df vectors, performed various tokenization and preprocessing steps to manipulate the data. In the example I have use Imdb movie reviews dataset, which is provided along with the notebook.
In last to classify the sentiment as a positive or negative one we have use Logistic Regression.Saved model is also provided, for saving the model in local disk I have used Pickle library from Python.

Changes you have to made while using your own dataset:

1.You have to change the address of the file(csv file) according to the location of dataset file you are using, I'm storing the data in the same folder that store notebook also.

2.Rename the variables according to your need and understanding.

All the Sentiment Analysis is done regarding the dataset available, Some techniques and manipulations will be changed according to change in data.
