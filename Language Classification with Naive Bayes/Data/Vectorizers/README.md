This contains the Final model that we have trained and saved so the we can use it to classify the test sentences.Since in the start I have added how the classification works so model usage is depicted there. It conatins all the preprcoessing steps and vectorizer also.

In my model I am using Count Vectorizer for vectorising the data, since this project is for basic learning of language classification.
