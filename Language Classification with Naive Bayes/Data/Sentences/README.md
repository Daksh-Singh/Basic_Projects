This contains all the data I am using for language classification. The data comprises of three different language sentences namely English,Czech and Slovak. The data is didvide into two categories, train data is used for training the model and validation data is used to validate the model.

English and Slovak contains 100 sentences whereas Czech contains 10 sentences. Less amount of data is used as this project is only for learning basic concepts of Language Classification and Naive Bayes.
