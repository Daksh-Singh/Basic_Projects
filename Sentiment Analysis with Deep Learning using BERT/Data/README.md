For the Sentiment Analysis I am using SMILE dataset which contains a certain unique Id with different tweets alongside with the emotions that are interpreted from those tweets.

Some of the categories are labeled as nocode which I have removed in preprocessing stages. Mainly there are six categories on which I have done Sentiment Analysis namely Happy, Angry, Disgust, Sad, Surprise and Not Relevant.

This folder contains the data that I am using for the Project.
