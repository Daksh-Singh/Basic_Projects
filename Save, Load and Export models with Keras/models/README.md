This folder contains the model architecture file that are created while training the model using the Checkpoint callbacks with Keras. Since the model is trained for the two epochs only that's why there are model files since save best only is set to True. 

While loading the model please ensure that self trained model file should be loaded since the name of the model file is set according to the epoch and validation accuracy of the model in that epoch respectively.
