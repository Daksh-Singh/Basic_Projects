This Notebook contains some of the basic techniques or I can say some basic starting steps that we need to perform for the Univariate Linear Regression.

I have defined my own functions namely for cost function and Gradient Descent. Initailly, I have used Seaborn to plot the input data using scatter plot and the regression line is plotted using lineplot. I have used 3D plot also to enhance the visualization, using plot surface and gca function for visualizing the cost surface.  All the example data is given along with the notebook, but you can run the notebook locally with your own data.

Changes you have to made while using your own dataset:

1.You have to change the address of the file(csv file or text file) according to the location of dataset file you are using, I'm storing the data in the same folder that store notebook also.

2.Rename the variables according to your need and understanding.

All the Analysis is done regarding the dataset available, Some techniques and manipulations will be changed according to change in data.

Some of the In-Notebook plots are:
