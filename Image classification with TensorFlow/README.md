This Notebook contains some of the basic techniques of Image Classification with Tensorflow. For illustration I have used MNIST dataset from the Keras Datasets class for the classification purpose.

I have only used the basic Dense layer for the classification purpose with Relu and softmax activations. With this much simple neural network I am able to attain an accuracy of 96 percent in validation and testing. I have used one-hot encoding so that no labels will get weight biasing as well as I have normalized the pixel values also.

Changes you have to made while using your own dataset or image:

1.You have to change the address of the file(image file or dataset directory) according to the location of dataset file you are using. I am using dataset from the Keras library.

2.Rename the variables according to your need and understanding.
